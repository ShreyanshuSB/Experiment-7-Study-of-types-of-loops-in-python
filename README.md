# Title

Study and Implementation of For Loop and While Loop in Python

# Aim

To learn and practically implement the working of for loop and while loop in Python programming.

# Objectives

To understand the concept of repetition and iterative execution.

To create and execute loops for basic iteration tasks.

To implement loop control statements such as break and continue.

To differentiate between entry-controlled loops and sequence-based loops.

# Theory

Looping is a programming control structure that enables repeated execution of a block of code either based on a condition or by traversing elements in a sequence. Python mainly provides two looping constructs: the for loop and the while loop.

1. For Loop

In Python, the for loop is used to iterate over elements of a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, set, or dictionary. It works as an iterator that executes a block of statements once for every element in the collection. It is especially useful when the number of iterations is predetermined or when working directly with sequences.

2. While Loop

The while loop is a control statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified Boolean condition remains true. It is mainly used when the number of iterations is uncertain and depends entirely on a condition being satisfied.

Difference Between For Loop and While Loop

A for loop is preferred when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

A while loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a condition.

The for loop automatically manages iteration over sequences.

The while loop requires manual updating of the loop control variable.

Characteristics of Loops

Iterative Nature: Executes code repeatedly to process data structures such as lists, sets, and dictionaries.

Control Mechanism: Regulates the execution flow based on conditions.

Efficiency: Minimizes repetition of code and improves readability.

Automation: Widely used in mathematical calculations and data manipulation tasks.

Break Statement

The break statement is used to immediately terminate a loop before its normal completion. When executed, the loop stops instantly, and control shifts to the next statement following the loop. It is commonly used within conditional statements to exit the loop when a specific condition is met.

Continue Statement

The continue statement skips the remaining part of the current iteration and proceeds directly to the next iteration of the loop. Unlike the break statement, it does not end the loop but only bypasses the remaining statements for that cycle.

# Summary of Key Concepts

For Loop: Used to iterate over a sequence or collection of elements.

While Loop: Executes repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

Break Statement: Ends the loop immediately.

Continue Statement: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.

Applications of Loops

Data Processing: Iterating through records such as student details.

Configuration Handling: Accessing values from dictionary-based settings.

Filtering Operations: Checking membership and removing duplicates.

Automation: Performing repetitive calculations and updating records.

# Conclusion

Loops play a crucial role in programming by efficiently handling repetitive tasks and enabling traversal of data structures like lists, sets, and dictionaries. The use of control statements such as break and continue enhances flexibility and precision in execution flow. Therefore, loops are fundamental constructs for solving real-world computational problems effectively.
